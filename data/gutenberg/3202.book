[10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 trillion] this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.  at our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 etexts unless we manage to get some real funding.  something is needed to create a future for project gutenberg for the next 100 years.  we need your donations more than ever!  presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in: texas, nevada, idaho, montana, wyoming, colorado, south dakota, iowa, indiana, and vermont. as the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.  all donations should be made to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and will be tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.  mail to:  project gutenberg literary archive foundation pmb 113 1739 university avenue oxford, ms 38655 [usa]  we are working with the project gutenberg literary archive foundation to build more stable support and ensure the future of project gutenberg.  we need your donations more than ever!  you can get up to date donation information at:  http://www.gutenberg.net/donation.html  ***  you can always email directly to:  michael s. hart <hart@pobox.com>  hart@pobox.com forwards to hart@prairienet.org and archive.org if your mail bounces from archive.org, i will still see it, if it bounces from prairienet.org, better resend later on. . . .  we would prefer to send you this information by email.  example command-line ftp session:  ftp metalab.unc.edu login: anonymous password: your@login cd pub/docs/books/gutenberg cd etext90 through etext99 or etext00 through etext01, etc. dir [to see files] get or mget [to get files. . .set bin for zip files] get gutindex.??
