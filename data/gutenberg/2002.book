let me count the ways     xliv beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers     i     i thought once how theocritus had sung   of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,   who each one in a gracious hand appears   to bear a gift for mortals, old or young:   and, as i mused it in his antique tongue,   i saw, in gradual vision through my tears,   the sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,   those of my own life, who by turns had flung   a shadow across me. straightway i was ’ware,   so weeping, how a mystic shape did move   behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;   and a voice said in mastery, while i strove,—   “guess now who holds thee!”—“death,” i said, but, there,   the silver answer rang, “not death, but love.”     ii     but only three in all god’s universe   have heard this word thou hast said,—himself, beside   thee speaking, and me listening! and replied   one of us . . . that was god, . . . and laid the curse   so darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce   my sight from seeing thee,—that if i had died,   the death-weights, placed there, would have signified   less absolute exclusion. “nay” is worse   from god than from all others, o my friend!   men could not part us with their worldly jars,   nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;   our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:   and, heaven being rolled between us at the end,   we should but vow the faster for the stars.     iii     unlike are we, unlike, o princely heart!   unlike our uses and our destinies.   our ministering two angels look surprise   on one another, as they strike athwart   their wings in passing. thou, bethink thee, art   a guest for queens to social pageantries,   with gages from a hundred brighter eyes   than tears even can make mine, to play thy part   of chief musician. what hast thou to do   with looking from the lattice-lights at me,   a poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through   the dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?   the chrism is on thine head,—on mine, the dew,—   and death must dig the level where these agree.     iv     thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor,   most gracious singer of high poems! where   the dancers will break footing, from the care   of watching up thy pregnant lips for more.   and dost thou lift this house’s latch too poor   for hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear   to let thy music drop here unaware   in folds of golden fulness at my door?   look up and see the casement broken in,   the bats and owlets builders in the roof!   my cricket chirps against thy mandolin.   hush, call no echo up in further proof   of desolation! there’s a voice within   that weeps . . . as thou must sing . . . alone, aloof.     v     i lift my heavy heart up solemnly,   as once electra her sepulchral urn,   and, looking in thine eyes, i over-turn   the ashes at thy feet. behold and see   what a great heap of grief lay hid in me,   and how the red wild sparkles dimly burn   through the ashen greyness. if thy foot in scorn   could tread them out to darkness utterly,   it might be well perhaps. but if instead   thou wait beside me for the wind to blow   the grey dust up, . . . those laurels on thine head,   o my belovëd, will not shield thee so,   that none of all the fires shall scorch and shred   the hair beneath. stand further off then! go!     vi     go from me. yet i feel that i shall stand   henceforward in thy shadow. nevermore   alone upon the threshold of my door   of individual life, i shall command   the uses of my soul, nor lift my hand   serenely in the sunshine as before,   without the sense of that which i forbore—   thy touch upon the palm. the widest land   doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine   with pulses that beat double. what i do   and what i dream include thee, as the wine   must taste of its own grapes. and when i sue   god for myself, he hears that name of thine,   and sees within my eyes the tears of two.     vii     the face of all the world is changed, i think,   since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul   move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole   betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink   of obvious death, where i, who thought to sink,   was caught up into love, and taught the whole   of life in a new rhythm. the cup of dole   god gave for baptism, i am fain to drink,   and praise its sweetness, sweet, with thee anear.   the names of country, heaven, are changed away   for where thou art or shalt be, there or here;   and this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,   (the singing angels know) are only dear   because thy name moves right in what they say.     viii     what can i give thee back, o liberal   and princely giver, who hast brought the gold   and purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,   and laid them on the outside of the wall   for such as i to take or leave withal,   in unexpected largesse? am i cold,   ungrateful, that for these most manifold   high gifts, i render nothing back at all?   not so; not cold,—but very poor instead.   ask god who knows. for frequent tears have run   the colours from my life, and left so dead   and pale a stuff, it were not fitly done   to give the same as pillow to thy head.   go farther! let it serve to trample on.     ix     can it be right to give what i can give?   to let thee sit beneath the fall of tears   as salt as mine, and hear the sighing years   re-sighing on my lips renunciative   through those infrequent smiles which fail to live   for all thy adjurations? o my fears,   that this can scarce be right! we are not peers   so to be lovers; and i own, and grieve,   that givers of such gifts as mine are, must   be counted with the ungenerous. out, alas!   i will not soil thy purple with my dust,   nor breathe my poison on thy venice-glass,   nor give thee any love—which were unjust.   beloved, i only love thee! let it pass.     x     yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed   and worthy of acceptation. fire is bright,   let temple burn, or flax; an equal light   leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:   and love is fire. and when i say at need   i love thee . . . mark! . . . i love thee—in thy sight   i stand transfigured, glorified aright,   with conscience of the new rays that proceed   out of my face toward thine. there’s nothing low   in love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures   who love god, god accepts while loving so.   and what i feel, across the inferior features   of what i am, doth flash itself, and show   how that great work of love enhances nature’s.     xi     and therefore if to love can be desert,   i am not all unworthy. cheeks as pale   as these you see, and trembling knees that fail   to bear the burden of a heavy heart,—   this weary minstrel-life that once was girt   to climb aornus, and can scarce avail   to pipe now ’gainst the valley nightingale   a melancholy music,—why advert   to these things? o belovëd, it is plain   i am not of thy worth nor for thy place!   and yet, because i love thee, i obtain   from that same love this vindicating grace   to live on still in love, and yet in vain,—   to bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.     xii     indeed this very love which is my boast,   and which, when rising up from breast to brow,   doth crown me with a ruby large enow   to draw men’s eyes and prove the inner cost,—   this love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,   i should not love withal, unless that thou   hadst set me an example, shown me how,   when first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,   and love called love. and thus, i cannot speak   of love even, as a good thing of my own:   thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,   and placed it by thee on a golden throne,—   and that i love (o soul, we must be meek!)   is by thee only, whom i love alone.     xiii     and wilt thou have me fashion into speech   the love i bear thee, finding words enough,   and hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,   between our faces, to cast light on each?—   i drop it at thy feet. i cannot teach   my hand to hold my spirits so far off   from myself—me—that i should bring thee proof   in words, of love hid in me out of reach.   nay, let the silence of my womanhood   commend my woman-love to thy belief,—   seeing that i stand unwon, however wooed,   and rend the garment of my life, in brief,   by a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,   lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.     xiv     if thou must love me, let it be for nought   except for love’s sake only. do not say   “i love her for her smile—her look—her way   of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought   that falls in well with mine, and certes brought   a sense of pleasant ease on such a day”—   for these things in themselves, belovëd, may   be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,   may be unwrought so. neither love me for   thine own dear pity’s wiping my cheeks dry,—   a creature might forget to weep, who bore   thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!   but love me for love’s sake, that evermore   thou may’st love on, through love’s eternity.     xv     accuse me not, beseech thee, that i wear   too calm and sad a face in front of thine;   for we two look two ways, and cannot shine   with the same sunlight on our brow and hair.   on me thou lookest with no doubting care,   as on a bee shut in a crystalline;   since sorrow hath shut me safe in love’s divine,   and to spread wing and fly in the outer air   were most impossible failure, if i strove   to fail so. but i look on thee—on thee—   beholding, besides love, the end of love,   hearing oblivion beyond memory;   as one who sits and gazes from above,   over the rivers to the bitter sea.     xvi     and yet, because thou overcomest so,   because thou art more noble and like a king,   thou canst prevail against my fears and fling   thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow   too close against thine heart henceforth to know   how it shook when alone. why, conquering   may prove as lordly and complete a thing   in lifting upward, as in crushing low!   and as a vanquished soldier yields his sword   to one who lifts him from the bloody earth,   even so, belovëd, i at last record,   here ends my strife. if thou invite me forth,   i rise above abasement at the word.   make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!     xvii     my poet, thou canst touch on all the notes   god set between his after and before,   and strike up and strike off the general roar   of the rushing worlds a melody that floats   in a serene air purely. antidotes   of medicated music, answering for   mankind’s forlornest uses, thou canst pour   from thence into their ears. god’s will devotes   thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.   how, dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?   a hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine   sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?   a shade, in which to sing—of palm or pine?   a grave, on which to rest from singing? choose.     xviii     i never gave a lock of hair away   to a man, dearest, except this to thee,   which now upon my fingers thoughtfully   i ring out to the full brown length and say   “take it.” my day of youth went yesterday;   my hair no longer bounds to my foot’s glee,   nor plant i it from rose- or myrtle-tree,   as girls do, any more: it only may   now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,   taught drooping from the head that hangs aside   through sorrow’s trick. i thought the funeral-shears   would take this first, but love is justified,—   take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years,   the kiss my mother left here when she died.     xix     the soul’s rialto hath its merchandize;   i barter curl for curl upon that mart,   and from my poet’s forehead to my heart   receive this lock which outweighs argosies,—   as purply black, as erst to pindar’s eyes   the dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart   the nine white muse-brows. for this counterpart, . . .   the bay crown’s shade, belovëd, i surmise,   still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!   thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,   i tie the shadows safe from gliding back,   and lay the gift where nothing hindereth;   here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack   no natural heat till mine grows cold in death.     xx     belovëd, my belovëd, when i think   that thou wast in the world a year ago,   what time i sat alone here in the snow   and saw no footprint, heard the silence sink   no moment at thy voice, but, link by link,   went counting all my chains as if that so   they never could fall off at any blow   struck by thy possible hand,—why, thus i drink   of life’s great cup of wonder! wonderful,   never to feel thee thrill the day or night   with personal act or speech,—nor ever cull   some prescience of thee with the blossoms white   thou sawest growing! atheists are as dull,   who cannot guess god’s presence out of sight.     xxi     say over again, and yet once over again,   that thou dost love me. though the word repeated   should seem a “cuckoo-song,” as thou dost treat it,   remember, never to the hill or plain,   valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain   comes the fresh spring in all her green completed.   belovëd, i, amid the darkness greeted   by a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt’s pain   cry, “speak once more—thou lovest!” who can fear   too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,   too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?   say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll   the silver iterance!—only minding, dear,   to love me also in silence with thy soul.     xxii     when our two souls stand up erect and strong,   face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,   until the lengthening wings break into fire   at either curvëd point,—what bitter wrong   can the earth do to us, that we should not long   be here contented? think! in mounting higher,   the angels would press on us and aspire   to drop some golden orb of perfect song   into our deep, dear silence. let us stay   rather on earth, belovëd,—where the unfit   contrarious moods of men recoil away   and isolate pure spirits, and permit   a place to stand and love in for a day,   with darkness and the death-hour rounding it.     xxiii     is it indeed so? if i lay here dead,   wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?   and would the sun for thee more coldly shine   because of grave-damps falling round my head?   i marvelled, my belovëd, when i read   thy thought so in the letter. i am thine—   but . . . so much to thee? can i pour thy wine   while my hands tremble? then my soul, instead   of dreams of death, resumes life’s lower range.   then, love me, love! look on me—breathe on me!   as brighter ladies do not count it strange,   for love, to give up acres and degree,   i yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange   my near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!     xxiv     let the world’s sharpness like a clasping knife   shut in upon itself and do no harm   in this close hand of love, now soft and warm,   and let us hear no sound of human strife   after the click of the shutting. life to life—   i lean upon thee, dear, without alarm,   and feel as safe as guarded by a charm   against the stab of worldlings, who if rife   are weak to injure. very whitely still   the lilies of our lives may reassure   their blossoms from their roots, accessible   alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer;   growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill.   god only, who made us rich, can make us poor.     xxv     a heavy heart, belovëd, have i borne   from year to year until i saw thy face,   and sorrow after sorrow took the place   of all those natural joys as lightly worn   as the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn   by a beating heart at dance-time. hopes apace   were changed to long despairs, till god’s own grace   could scarcely lift above the world forlorn   my heavy heart. then thou didst bid me bring   and let it drop adown thy calmly great   deep being! fast it sinketh, as a thing   which its own nature does precipitate,   while thine doth close above it, mediating   betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.     xxvi     i lived with visions for my company   instead of men and women, years ago,   and found them gentle mates, nor thought to know   a sweeter music than they played to me.   but soon their trailing purple was not free   of this world’s dust, their lutes did silent grow,   and i myself grew faint and blind below   their vanishing eyes. then thou didst come—to be,   belovëd, what they seemed. their shining fronts,   their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,   as river-water hallowed into fonts)   met in thee, and from out thee overcame   my soul with satisfaction of all wants:   because god’s gifts put man’s best dreams to shame.     xxvii     my own belovëd, who hast lifted me   from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown,   and, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown   a life-breath, till the forehead hopefully   shines out again, as all the angels see,   before thy saving kiss! my own, my own,   who camest to me when the world was gone,   and i who looked for only god, found thee!   i find thee; i am safe, and strong, and glad.   as one who stands in dewless asphodel,   looks backward on the tedious time he had   in the upper life,—so i, with bosom-swell,   make witness, here, between the good and bad,   that love, as strong as death, retrieves as well.     xxviii     my letters! all dead paper, mute and white!   and yet they seem alive and quivering   against my tremulous hands which loose the string   and let them drop down on my knee to-night.   this said,—he wished to have me in his sight   once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring   to come and touch my hand . . . a simple thing,   yet i wept for it!—this, . . . the paper’s light . . .   said, dear i love thee; and i sank and quailed   as if god’s future thundered on my past.   this said, i am thine—and so its ink has paled   with lying at my heart that beat too fast.   and this . . . o love, thy words have ill availed   if, what this said, i dared repeat at last!     xxix     i think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and bud   about thee, as wild vines, about a tree,   put out broad leaves, and soon there’s nought to see   except the straggling green which hides the wood.   yet, o my palm-tree, be it understood   i will not have my thoughts instead of thee   who art dearer, better! rather, instantly   renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,   rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,   and let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,   drop heavily down,—burst, shattered everywhere!   because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee   and breathe within thy shadow a new air,   i do not think of thee—i am too near thee.     xxx     i see thine image through my tears to-night,   and yet to-day i saw thee smiling. how   refer the cause?—belovëd, is it thou   or i, who makes me sad? the acolyte   amid the chanted joy and thankful rite   may so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,   on the altar-stair. i hear thy voice and vow,   perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,   as he, in his swooning ears, the choir’s amen.   belovëd, dost thou love? or did i see all   the glory as i dreamed, and fainted when   too vehement light dilated my ideal,   for my soul’s eyes? will that light come again,   as now these tears come—falling hot and real?     xxxi     thou comest! all is said without a word.   i sit beneath thy looks, as children do   in the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through   their happy eyelids from an unaverred   yet prodigal inward joy. behold, i erred   in that last doubt! and yet i cannot rue   the sin most, but the occasion—that we two   should for a moment stand unministered   by a mutual presence. ah, keep near and close,   thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,   with thy broad heart serenely interpose:   brood down with thy divine sufficiencies   these thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,   like callow birds left desert to the skies.     xxxii     the first time that the sun rose on thine oath   to love me, i looked forward to the moon   to slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon   and quickly tied to make a lasting troth.   quick-loving hearts, i thought, may quickly loathe;   and, looking on myself, i seemed not one   for such man’s love!—more like an out-of-tune   worn viol, a good singer would be wroth   to spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,   is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.   i did not wrong myself so, but i placed   a wrong on thee. for perfect strains may float   ’neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,—   and great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.     xxxiii     yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear   the name i used to run at, when a child,   from innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied,   to glance up in some face that proved me dear   with the look of its eyes. i miss the clear   fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled   into the music of heaven’s undefiled,   call me no longer. silence on the bier,   while i call god—call god!—so let thy mouth   be heir to those who are now exanimate.   gather the north flowers to complete the south,   and catch the early love up in the late.   yes, call me by that name,—and i, in truth,   with the same heart, will answer and not wait.     xxxiv     with the same heart, i said, i’ll answer thee   as those, when thou shalt call me by my name—   lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,   perplexed and ruffled by life’s strategy?   when called before, i told how hastily   i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.   to run and answer with the smile that came   at play last moment, and went on with me   through my obedience. when i answer now,   i drop a grave thought, break from solitude;   yet still my heart goes to thee—ponder how—   not as to a single good, but all my good!   lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow   that no child’s foot could run fast as this blood.     xxxv     if i leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange   and be all to me? shall i never miss   home-talk and blessing and the common kiss   that comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,   when i look up, to drop on a new range   of walls and floors, another home than this?   nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is   filled by dead eyes too tender to know change   that’s hardest. if to conquer love, has tried,   to conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove,   for grief indeed is love and grief beside.   alas, i have grieved so i am hard to love.   yet love me—wilt thou? open thy heart wide,   and fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.     xxxvi     when we met first and loved, i did not build   upon the event with marble. could it mean   to last, a love set pendulous between   sorrow and sorrow? nay, i rather thrilled,   distrusting every light that seemed to gild   the onward path, and feared to overlean   a finger even. and, though i have grown serene   and strong since then, i think that god has willed   a still renewable fear . . . o love, o troth . . .   lest these enclaspëd hands should never hold,   this mutual kiss drop down between us both   as an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.   and love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,   must lose one joy, by his life’s star foretold.     xxxvii     pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make   of all that strong divineness which i know   for thine and thee, an image only so   formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.   it is that distant years which did not take   thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,   have forced my swimming brain to undergo   their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake   thy purity of likeness and distort   thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit.   as if a shipwrecked pagan, safe in port,   his guardian sea-god to commemorate,   should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort   and vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.     xxxviii     first time he kissed me, he but only kissed   the fingers of this hand wherewith i write;   and ever since, it grew more clean and white.   slow to world-greetings, quick with its “o, list,”   when the angels speak. a ring of amethyst   i could not wear here, plainer to my sight,   than that first kiss. the second passed in height   the first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,   half falling on the hair. o beyond meed!   that was the chrism of love, which love’s own crown,   with sanctifying sweetness, did precede   the third upon my lips was folded down   in perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,   i have been proud and said, “my love, my own.”     xxxix     because thou hast the power and own’st the grace   to look through and behind this mask of me,   (against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,   with their rains,) and behold my soul’s true face,   the dim and weary witness of life’s race,—   because thou hast the faith and love to see,   through that same soul’s distracting lethargy,   the patient angel waiting for a place   in the new heavens,—because nor sin nor woe,   nor god’s infliction, nor death’s neighbourhood,   nor all which others viewing, turn to go,   nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,—   nothing repels thee, . . . dearest, teach me so   to pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!     xl     oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!   i will not gainsay love, called love forsooth:   i have heard love talked in my early youth,   and since, not so long back but that the flowers   then gathered, smell still. mussulmans and giaours   throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth   for any weeping. polypheme’s white tooth   slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,   the shell is over-smooth,—and not so much   will turn the thing called love, aside to hate   or else to oblivion. but thou art not such   a lover, my belovëd! thou canst wait   through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,   and think it soon when others cry “too late.”     xli     i thank all who have loved me in their hearts,   with thanks and love from mine. deep thanks to all   who paused a little near the prison-wall   to hear my music in its louder parts   ere they went onward, each one to the mart’s   or temple’s occupation, beyond call.   but thou, who, in my voice’s sink and fall   when the sob took it, thy divinest art’s   own instrument didst drop down at thy foot   to harken what i said between my tears, . . .   instruct me how to thank thee! oh, to shoot   my soul’s full meaning into future years,   that they should lend it utterance, and salute   love that endures, from life that disappears!     xlii     my future will not copy fair my past—   i wrote that once; and thinking at my side   my ministering life-angel justified   the word by his appealing look upcast   to the white throne of god, i turned at last,   and there, instead, saw thee, not unallied   to angels in thy soul! then i, long tried   by natural ills, received the comfort fast,   while budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim’s staff   gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.   i seek no copy now of life’s first half:   leave here the pages with long musing curled,   and write me new my future’s epigraph,   new angel mine, unhoped for in the world!     xliii     how do i love thee? let me count the ways.   i love thee to the depth and breadth and height   my soul can reach, when feeling out of sight   for the ends of being and ideal grace.   i love thee to the level of everyday’s   most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.   i love thee freely, as men strive for right;   i love thee purely, as they turn from praise.   i love thee with the passion put to use   in my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.   i love thee with a love i seemed to lose   with my lost saints,—i love thee with the breath,   smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if god choose,   i shall but love thee better after death.     xliv     belovëd, thou hast brought me many flowers   plucked in the garden, all the summer through,   and winter, and it seemed as if they grew   in this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.   so, in the like name of that love of ours,   take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,   and which on warm and cold days i withdrew   from my heart’s ground. indeed, those beds and bowers   be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,   and wait thy weeding; yet here’s eglantine,   here’s ivy!—take them, as i used to do   thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.   instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,   and tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.     ***end of the project gutenberg ebook sonnets from the portuguese***   ******* this file should be named 2002-0.txt or 2002-0.zip *******   this and all associated files of various formats will be found in: http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/0/0/2002   updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.  creating the works from print editions not protected by u.s. copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties. special rules, set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark. project gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks, unless you receive specific permission. if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the rules is very easy. you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research. they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically anything in the united states with ebooks not protected by u.s. copyright law. redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.  start: full license  the full project gutenberg license please read this before you distribute or use this work  to protect the project gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "project gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the full project gutenberg-tm license available with this file or online at www.gutenberg.org/license.  section 1. general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works  1.a. by reading or using any part of this project gutenberg-tm electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement. if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession. if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.  1.b.
