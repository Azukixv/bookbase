and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. --such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. to prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.  he has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  he has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws of naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.  he has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.  he has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  he has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.  he has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures.  he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.  he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:  for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  for protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:  for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:  for imposing taxes on us without our consent:  for depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:  for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:  for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies:  for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:  for suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  he has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.  he has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation.  he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.  he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. a prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  nor have we been wanting in attention to our british brethren. we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. we must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.  we, therefore, the representatives of the united states of america, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. and for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.    december, 1972 [etext #2]   ****the project gutenberg etext of the u. s. bill of rights****    the united states bill of rights.  the ten original amendments to the constitution of the united states passed by congress september 25, 1789 ratified december 15, 1791    i  congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;

before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction. we dare not tempt them with weakness. for only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.  so let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate. let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us. let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations. let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce. let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of isaiah. . .to "undo the heavy burdens. . . let the oppressed go free."  and if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . . let both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . . but a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . . and the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .  all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . . nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. but let us begin.  in your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the final success or failure of our course. since this country was founded, each generation of americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. the graves of young americans who answered the call to service surround the globe. now the trumpet summons us again. . . not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . . though embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself. can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance. . .north and south. . . east and west. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? will you join in that historic effort?  in the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; i do not shrink from this responsibility. . .i welcome it. i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. the energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.  and so, my fellow americans. . .ask not what your country can do for you. . .ask what you can do for your country. my fellow citizens of the world. . .ask not what america will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.  finally, whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. with a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds;

but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the congress.  the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states; and nothing in this constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the united states, or of any particular state.  section 4. the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.   article five  the congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the congress;

and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the united states, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.  the senators and representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the united states and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states  article seven  the ratification of the conventions of nine states, shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same.  done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present the seventeenth day of september in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven and of the independence of the united states of america the twelfth    in witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names,  go. washington-- presid. and deputy from virginia  new hampshire  john langdon nicholas gilman  massachusetts  nathaniel gorham rufus king  connecticut  wm. saml. johnson roger herman  new york  alexander hamilton  new jersey  wil: livingston david brearley wm. paterson jona: dayton  pennsylvania  b franklin thomas mifflin robt morris geo. clymer thos fitzsimons jared ingersoll james wilson gouv morris  delaware  geo: read gunning bedford jun john dickinson richard bassett jaco: broom  maryland  james mchenry dan of st thos. jenifer danl carroll  virginia  john blair-- james madison jr.  north carolina  wm. blount rich'd dobbs spaight hu williamson  south carolina  j. rutledge charles cotesworth pinckney charles pinckney pierce butler  georgia  william few abr baldwin   attest: william jackson, secretary     december, 1975 [etext #6]   the project gutenberg etext of give me liberty or give me death  officially released in december 1975, unofficially released for the 200th anniversary of the speech by patrick henry before the "house" as he referred to it. [which was the virgina provincial convention, march 23, 1775]   give me liberty or give me death   patrick henry, march 23, 1775.   no man thinks more highly than i do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house. but different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, i hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as i do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, i shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. this is no time for ceremony. the questing before the house is one of awful moment to this country. for my own part, i consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. it is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to god and our country. should i keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, i should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the majesty of heaven, which i revere above all earthly kings.  mr. president, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? for my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, i am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.  i have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. and judging by the past, i wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house. is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? let us not deceive ourselves, sir. these are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. i ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? has great britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? no, sir, she has none. they are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. they are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging. and what have we to oppose to them? shall we try argument? sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. have we anything new to offer upon the subject? nothing. we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? let us not, i beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. we have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament. our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! in vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. there is no longer any room for hope. if we wish to be free-- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight! i repeat it, sir, we must fight! an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us!  they tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. but when shall we be stronger? will it be the next week, or the next year? will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a british guard shall be stationed in every house? shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction? shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature hath placed in our power. the millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. there is a just god who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. the battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. besides, sir, we have no election. if we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. there is no retreat but in submission and slavery! our chains are forged! their clanking may be heard on the plains of boston! the war is inevitable--and let it come! i repeat it, sir, let it come.  it is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. gentlemen may cry, peace, peace-- but there is no peace. the war is actually begun! the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! our brethren are already in the field! why stand we here idle? what is it that gentlemen wish? what would they have? is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? forbid it, almighty god!

"woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of god, must needs come, but which, having continued through his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him? fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. yet, if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, "the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether."  with malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as god gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.     december, 1979 [etext #9]  the project gutenberg etext of lincoln's 1st inaugural address    lincoln's first inaugural address march 4, 1861    fellow citizens of the united states: in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself, i appear before you to address you briefly and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states, to be taken by the president "before he enters on the execution of his office."  i do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.  apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that "i have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery where it exists. i believe i have no lawful right to do so, and i have no inclination to do so." those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them. and, more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read:  "resolved: that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states, and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes."  i now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. i add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause-- as cheerfully to one section as to another.  there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions:  "no person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."  it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law. all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution-- to this provision as much as to any other. to the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause "shall be delivered up", their oaths are unanimous. now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?  there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one. if the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done. and should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?  again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that "the citizen of each state shall be entitled to all privileged and immunities of citizens in the several states?"  i take the official oath today with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules. and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced, i do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.  it is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution. during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the executive branch of the government. they have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success. yet, with all this scope of precedent, i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. a disruption of the federal union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.  i hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution, the union of these states is perpetual. perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution, and the union will endure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself.  again, if the united states be not a government proper, but an association of states in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? one party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?  descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself. the union is much older than the constitution. it was formed, in fact, by the articles of association in 1774. it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776. it was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the articles of confederation in 1778. and, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was "to form a more perfect union."  but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible, the union is less perfect than before the constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.  it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any state or states, against the authority of the united states, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.  i therefore consider that, in view of the constitution and the laws, the union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability i shall take care, as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states. doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and i shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the american people, shall withhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary. i trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself.  in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. the power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere. where hostility to the united states, in any interior locality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices.  the mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union. so far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection. the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.  that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, i will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, i need address no word to them. to those, however, who really love the union may i not speak?  before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?  all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained. is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the constitution, has been denied? i think not. happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied. if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such a right were a vital one. but such is not our case. all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them. but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration. no foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible questions. shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or state authority? the constitution does not expressly say. may congress prohibit slavery in the territories? the constitution does not expressly say. must congress protect slavery in the territories? the constitution does not expressly say.  from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. if the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease. there is no other alternative; for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other.  if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. for instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it? all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.  is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?  plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.  i do not forget the position, assumed by some, that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court; nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government. and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. at the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.  one section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. this is the only substantial dispute. the fugitive-slave clause of the constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. this, i think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. the foreign slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived, without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.  physically speaking, we cannot separate. we cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. a husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this. they cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before? can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.  this country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. i cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended. while i make no recommendation of amendments, i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and i should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it. i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse. i understand a proposed amendment to the constitution--which amendment, however, i have not seen--has passed congress, to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states, including that of persons held to service. to avoid misconstruction of what i have said, i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.  the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states. the people themselves can do this also if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to do with it. his duty is to administer the present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor.  why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? is there any better or equal hope in the world? in our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right? if the almighty ruler of nations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the north, or on yours of the south, that truth and that justice will surely prevail, by the judgment of this great tribunal, the american people.  by the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals. while the people retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years.  my countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject. nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it. such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action. intelligence, patriotism, christianity, and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.  in your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. the government will not assail you. you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _i_ shall have the most solemn one to "preserve, protect, and defend it."  i am loathe to close. we are not enemies, but friends. we must not be enemies. though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. the mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.  ***end of the collected etexts of project gutenberg of the 1970's*** **we hope to rely on your continued support until the end of 2001,** when we hope to have presented the 10,000th project gutenberg etext!    ===============    the project gutenberg ebook of the declaration of independence  copyright laws are changing all over the world. be sure to check the copyright laws for your country before downloading or redistributing this or any other project gutenberg ebook.  this header should be the first thing seen when viewing this project gutenberg file. please do not remove it. do not change or edit the header without written permission.  please read the "legal small print," and other information about the ebook and project gutenberg at the bottom of this file. included is important information about your specific rights and restrictions in how the file may be used. you can also find out about how to make a donation to project gutenberg, and how to get involved.   **welcome to the world of free plain vanilla electronic texts**  **ebooks readable by both humans and by computers, since 1971**  *****these ebooks were prepared by thousands of volunteers!*****   title: the declaration of independence  release date: december, 1971 [ebook #1] [most recently updated: november 25, 2004]  edition: 12  language: english   ***    the united states declaration of independence was the first etext released by project gutenberg, early in 1971. the title was stored in an emailed instruction set which required a tape or diskpack be hand mounted for retrieval. the diskpack was the size of a large cake in a cake carrier, cost $1500, and contained 5 megabytes, of which this file took 1-2%. two tape backups were kept plus one on paper tape. the 10,000 files we hope to have online by the end of 2001 should take about 1-2% of a comparably priced drive in 2001.  this file was never copyrighted, sharewared, etc., and is thus for all to use and copy in any manner they choose. please feel free to make your own edition using this as a base.  in my research for creating this transcription of our first etext, i have come across enough discrepancies [even within that official documentation provided by the united states] to conclude that even "facsimiles" of the declaration of indendence will not going to be all the same as the original, nor of other "facsimiles." there is a plethora of variations in capitalization, punctuation, and, even where names appear on the documents [which names i have left out].  the resulting document has several misspellings removed from those parchment "facsimiles" i used back in 1971, and which i should not be able to easily find at this time, including "brittain."

america     in congress, july 4, 1776  the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america    when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. --such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. to prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.  he has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  he has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws of naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.  he has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.  he has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  he has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.  he has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures.  he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.  he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:  for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  for protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:  for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:  for imposing taxes on us without our consent:  for depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:  for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:  for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies:  for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:  for suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  he has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.  he has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation.  he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.  he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. a prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  nor have we been wanting in attention to our brittish brethren. we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. we must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.  we, therefore, the representatives of the united states of america, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. and for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge

ebooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the us unless a copyright notice is included. thus, we usually do not keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  we are now trying to release all our ebooks one year in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing. please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections, even years after the official publication date.  please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement. the official release date of all project gutenberg ebooks is at midnight, central time, of the last day of the stated month. a preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so.  most people start at our web sites at: http://gutenberg.net or http://promo.net/pg  these web sites include award-winning information about project gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).   those of you who want to download any ebook before announcement can get to them as follows, and just download by date. this is also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an announcement goes out in the project gutenberg newsletter.  http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03  or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90  just search by the first five letters of the filename you want, as it appears in our newsletters.   information about project gutenberg (one page)  we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. the time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any ebook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  our projected audience is one hundred million readers. if the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text files per month: 1240 more ebooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+ we are already on our way to trying for 2000 more ebooks in 2002 if they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total will reach over half a trillion ebooks given away by year's end.  the goal of project gutenberg is to give away 1 trillion ebooks! this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.  here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):  ebooks year month    1 1971 july   10 1991 january  100 1994
